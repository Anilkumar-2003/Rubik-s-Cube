Rubik’s Cube Solver – Beginner-Level Explanation


Objective:
Build a small web-based Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver using JavaScript. The cube should:

Be represented logically in code.

Allow manual rotation of sides (like turning faces of a real cube).

Scramble randomly.

Solve itself step-by-step and return to the original state.

We focus on using object-oriented programming (OOP), arrays, and basic algorithms to simulate and reverse cube actions.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Representing the Cube (Using Object-Oriented Programming)
We use a JavaScript class to define the structure of the cube.
The Rubik’s Cube has 6 faces:

U (Up), D (Down), F (Front), B (Back), L (Left), R (Right)

Each face is a 3x3 grid (9 colored tiles).
We represent each face as an array of 9 elements, storing the color of each square.
We group all faces inside a cube object, making it easy to update or read face data.

This step uses OOP concepts like:

Classes

Constructor

Encapsulation (grouping cube data in one object)

 
2. Rotating a Face
Just like a real cube, each face can be turned clockwise or counterclockwise.
When a face is turned:

Its 9 squares are rearranged (face rotation)

Adjacent edge tiles on other faces are also affected

We simulate this by:

Reordering elements in the face’s array

Updating the connected edge tiles on the correct surrounding faces

This requires understanding index mapping, which helps us know how tiles move during a turn.



3. Storing Moves
Every time we rotate a face, we log the move — both the face and the direction (clockwise or not).
This history is important because it lets us reverse those actions later to solve the cube.

This is like building a stack (a Last-In-First-Out structure) where we can undo each move in reverse order.


4. Scrambling the Cube
To simulate a mixed-up cube:

We choose a random face

Rotate it in a random direction

Repeat multiple times (e.g., 5 or 10)

Each move is saved in the move history.
The result is a scrambled cube that we know how to retrace step-by-step.

This introduces randomness, looping, and basic math operations for generating scramble moves.

 
5. Solving the Cube
To solve the cube:

We go through the list of stored moves in reverse

For each move, we do the opposite rotation

This brings the cube back to the original (solved) state.

This is not an advanced solving algorithm like those used in speed-cubing, but it proves:

If we track the moves we made, we can always go back.

It’s similar to how undo functionality works in real apps (e.g., Ctrl + Z).


6. Displaying the Cube
For simplicity, we show the cube state using console output in the browser.
Each face is shown as a string of 9 characters (colors like 'w', 'y', 'g', etc.).

Every time a move is made or reversed, we show:

The move

The new cube state

This gives a clear step-by-step view of how the cube is transforming.

7. Simple User Interface
We wrap this logic in an HTML page:

Add two buttons: "Scramble" and "Solve"

Attach JavaScript functions to these buttons

Show output in a styled console box on the page

This uses basic HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation, which are key web development concepts.
